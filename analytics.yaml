        Provides occupancy insights for a location.

        Occupancy is defined as usage of a location. This incudes rooms, desks, lockers and other assets. At any point in time it is always either `0.0` (available) or `1.0` (in use), however the confidence of this may vary. When querying a time range, the ratio of in use to available time during the window is returned.
